# nodeJS-social-platform

https://feed-social-media-site.herokuapp.com/

The Express/Node.js back-end of my social media app, handling all CRUD operations on posts. Sockets are used to live update the feed for all clients. Cloudinary is used for image hosting. Mongoose was used to easily store data into MongoDB.
